        The men's A squad gives players the opportunity to compete at one of the highest possible levels of English
        volleyball. Competing in BUCS Western 1A for the 2019/20 season and pushing for promotion back into BUCS
        Premiership, as well as competing in Division 2 in the National Volleyball League means that players can really
        play at a high standard. The team also competes in competitions such as the Volleyball England Student Cup
        against the best teams in the country and in the BUCS Beach Student cup at the end of the year, as well as
        participating in Varsity: a university-wide competition against the University of West England.

        The team trains twice a week with coach Mauro Ceccarini and also has strength and conditioning sessions once a
        week and all players are expected to attend all of these sessions. This squad aims to push as far as we possibly
        can and realise that it's the small things that make all the difference. We also welcome beginners who show
        future potential as many of our players work their way up from beginners to starting 6 players within their time
        at University.

        It's not all hard work however as every Wednesday, the hair is let down as we head to Sports Night with the rest
        of the club and all the other University sports. Being part of a University sports team is as much about making
        friends as it is competing and other smaller social events such as pub trips and meals are a great way to get to
        know the rest of the team.
