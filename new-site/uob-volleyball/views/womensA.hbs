        Women's A squad gives players the opportunity to compete at one of the highest possible levels of English volleyball. Competing in Premier South league since September 2017, and keeping the highest standard not having dropped a league since. We also compete in the National Volleyball League, alongside the rest of the women's teams. The team also competes in competitions such as the Volleyball England Student Cup against the best teams in the country and in the BUCS Beach Student cup at the end of the year, as well as participating in Varsity: a university-wide competition against the University of West England.

        The team trains twice a week with a fully qualified coach, and also attends a Strength and Conditioning session once a week with a fully qualified trainer. This squad aims to push as far as we possibly can. We also welcome beginners who show future potential as many of our players work their way up from beginners to starting 6 players within their time at University.

        On top of all this fun, every Wednesday it's Sports day, meaning that after our matches we will rejoin the rest of the club for some friendly drinks and afterwards hit the club with the rest of the sports clubs. Being part of a University team is as much about making friends as it is competing and other smaller social events such as pub trips, meals and the winter formal are great ways of getting to know the rest of the club.
